More and more of the shows i watch are being removed yet my cost is going up. Got a new update today and now the shows that i still watch aren't playing. It keeps freezing up and is picking and choosing what it will play and what it won't. I'm getting closer and closer to dropping netflix by the day. Not a happy customer right now! 😒

I used to love watching Netflix on my phone, but since the last update over a month ago, it is using up my battery at an alarming rate. Even when it is force stopped, my phone feels hot and the battery won't last a day. Considering I can watch YouTube all day and barely lose half the battery, this is atrocious.

The app keeps draining my battery when I am not even using the app.  This has happed a couple of times.  I never had the app running but it showed up under battery usage as the highest consumer.\

Drains battery like crazy since a recent update, whether I'm using the app or not. Have to force kill it whenever I'm not using it to avoid battery getting drained.

The latest update has an issue where often the video hangs and freezes a while the audio continues. Internet speeds are between 10-20mbs vdsl which is more than adequate to run Netflix. Please fix this to get a 5 star review.

Was working perfectly, but after upgrade the app freezes, reboots, the picture gets pixelated, and gives the 5.2 error code quite often. I either have to reboot my phone or reinstall the app all together. Not acceptable service to pay for.

Recently, I cant even open it or switch profiles without a message appearing saying "Can't Connect to Netflix", even though my internet and my other apps work smoothly. What's going on?? Its been a huge inconvenience. I'm considering uninstalling.

This app is constantly crashing. I'm always having to restart, not just the app but my phone because I'll get a message saying my device needs to be restarted.

Not working on all my devices. Fix problem asap! I am not paying monthly to get "Can't Connect to Netflix" RETRY every time I open the app on my phone. Problem has been happening over the past few days, have updated app & still the same issue.

New updates have been hard to work with and use. Mostly great. Does turn off once every few days randomly. Also some movies have been removed and I'm slightly upset because I love Princess Bride and it's gone now. New movies are great to watch but wish they were added faster. Also I don't like that ...

I live in South Africa and I have the south African version of netflix or whatever but what really made me rate this a 3 stars out of 5 was because some shows aren't shown on Netflix here in South Africa such as 'Supernatural' and a couple other TV shows that my family and I love. I really expected Netflix to have 'all' the best TV shows on here but I guess not. Please can you add Supernatural to the South African version of Netflix, it would make my day and I'm pretty sure it would make many others very happy.

Great app, one of the best out there. Another review mentioned, Netflix being biased on content (Paid to promote content) and Prime video was not. I suggest you look into ownership and content partners of Prime Video and IMDB while you are at it, then the same for Netflix, and reassess your, ina...Full Review

So far I have loved netflix. I watched several series that I enjoyed everyday, but one by one they were taken off. The only thing I had left was phineas and ferb, and as of today, that is no longer available. Because of that, I will be unsubscribing tomorrow. Not even close to the selection they...Full Review

I swear you guys are doing this to spite me! The 10 second rewind/fast-forward were back for like a day and then when I come back the next day, what do you know! It's gone. Getting my hopes up and destroying it over and over again. Thanks for That!

Hello. The apps was my stress relieving after my work done. I am at saudi arabia right now. Can i have a questions.. Why there is no other season of riders of berks? Please put it in i am a really fan of how to train your dragon. Please add more season in this app.

"Yearly Download Limit" - I've just discovered this today as I tried downloading a movie but it got 'corrupted' half way through the film. After a few more times downloading the movie I had a pop up that I reached my "Yearly Download Limit". Get rid of this, I really wanted to watch the movie bu...Full Review

Netflix offers a verity of amazing shows and movies for all ages. Its very user friendly and easy to naviagate the app. The only problem i have with this app is that it keeps logging me out of my account whenever i try to watch a show. Also whenever i uninstall the app and restall the app it will...Full Review

I liked and like the Netflix app for Android phones. I especially enjoy the update that switched the thirty second rewind buttons into a 10 second rewind and forward buttons. One improvement that I would like to see is less "spawn" time for subtitles after a rewind. Most times after rewinding, t...Full Review

Netflix is great, but their Google play app and windows 8 app SUCKS. Netflix on my computer never loads through, so I just have to watch online. And the app sucks even worse. I dont watch 10 seconds of something before it glitches out and I have to sign in again. And then when I try to sign in i...Full Review

Everything on the app is great, but not actually being able to watch anything??? The audio and buttons work, I'm just left with a black screen with voices. Please fix!!! Netflix has always been my go to on iOS but its a let down on android

Since the last update, every time I open the app it logs me out! And when I click on a movie to watch it won't let me watch it. Even after multiple clicks. But I can watch any and all TV series without a problem. Please fix and I will fix my rating. Even though this is still a problem, i gave an ...Full Review

So the app itself is good, great variety of shows, however my only issue would be my lack of control when watching a video. So I can only rewind a video 30 seconds while in the past I could rewind and fast forward by 10 seconds (which is incredibly on mobile when the show rewinds itself when the...Full Review

New gui is ferociously terrible with new management. We used to skim through the spot we wanted to continue our show if we lwft off. Now its 10sec a time. Don't force dictate our journey on your now specialized shows. Spotify will be better with hulu if you try such shortcomings

My watchlist is located at the bottom of a neverending list of shows. It should be quick and easy to find. Instead, every time I open the app to watch something, I feel so irritated, I close the app and find an alternative place to watch. The layout is actually training me to hate netflix. I sho...Full Review

Entire family uses and loves Netflix. Extremely user friendly. Only 1 minor complaint; maybe once or twice a month the app will be slow/sit and spin but it's never been over 10-15 minutes before it's back to working perfectly. Highly recommend.

Netflix is one app I would expect to be available on all platforms of hardware, but much to my surprise my brand new Samsung Galaxy Tab A says Netflix is incompatible with my device. That to me is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE in an app as prolific as this. Until this app is available on EVERY device ...Full Review

Its logging me out every time I pause, backup, do anything... or leave the app and then try to go back in to continue a show. Very annoying. Will change rating when fixed.

I love the content on Netflix but the application is very buggy. Will loose connection with my Chromecast or just have a hard time connecting initially. Will loose sync with the audio/video. Becomes unresponsive when left alone while watching content, will have to close out of the app and discon...Full Review

Finally much awaited update is here. It was annoying to manually scroll the bar to fast forward, and if you wanted to forward only few seconds then good luck with that. Plus 30 seconds backward option was not a very great help either. Now I can watch my video stream the way I like it. Thanks Net...Full Review

You guys took my favorite show off here. And I was almost done with it. It makes me so freaking upset when I pay about 18$ a month to watch. You guys need to stop removing shows.

Hate it. Netflix has taken all the good series and movies off the platform. Now its a bloody app for kids programs, where is black sails, vikings you guys are shit

FINALLY THEY ADDED THE 10SEC FORWARDING AND REWINDING BACK. the 30 sec rewinding was rubbish. The app is so good however they need more and newer series/movies

Chromecast implementation is just awful. Most of the time the app isn't aware that it's playing anything which makes pausing impossible. Nobody st Netflix seems to care their app is total garbage.

The app is updated too frequently without adequate explanation, just bragging. Update frequency for bug fixes is inversely proportional to quality of developers. Weekly updates for an app to access a streaming web service means that it's buggy AND its management cannot make up their mind about w...Full Review

I absolutely love the new UI! It's modern, sleek, and intuitive to use! On top of that, it fixed issues with the virtual navigation bar on Android devices from sticking around occasionally while watching content.

Don't get me wrong, netflix is convenient and great. But that's if you can LOG IN. I know my login info, but Netflix says it's incorrect and refuses to let me sign in. But on my other devices I don't have this problem, because spoiler alert; I know my own login info. Customer support was zero he...Full Review

Was good over a year ago since then it went down horrible in service and i will continue to use them but not pay them as they have screwed me multiple times on my service, removed over half the shows i watched and then turned around and raised the price so they could "continue to provide me my f...Full Review

It was working all right until netfix had its recent update. When you disable the subtitles. The subtitles is still present after disabling. The subtitles of when it was disabled is clearly visable on screen instead of disappearing totally. 🤤

Before the last update the app worked great, since then I haven't been able to get the app to open. The website itself won't load either. When I called their customer service line, I was treated like I was an idiot and the service rep refused to listen to the fact I already did everything she was...Full Review

Ever since this apps recent update I can no longer use the app on my phone. It goes to the black screen that says netflix but will not go any further. As someone who pays to use this app I would like to be able to use it

I take it all back. What the hell Netflix not happy. One minute the new update gives us back the 10sec forward n rewind with the pause button in the middle of the screen now its gone again. I gave u a 4 star rateing now ur back to 3 not tht use deserve it. Make up ur damn minds. So sick of it. J...Full Review

For the last two days I have not been able to watch any movies because it says Netflix has stopped working if they don't fix it soon I am going to discontinue my service with them and find someone else so they need to get on the ball and fix the problem

Been working fine until today. The movies won't load. I tried to log out and log in again, it got stuck in the netflix splash screen and cannot log in. I tried my account on the same wifi network on my samsung tablet and it also won't load movies. However when I tried to log in on the same wifi ...Full Review

Netflix has revolutionized how we watch tv and movies. Unfortunately, they are a victim of their own success. If you are going to binge watch something they didn't create, do it quickly, because who knows if it will be around next month. And the apps have TERRIBLE UI. It's nice that they have a ...Full Review

They should bring back the star ratings. Thumbs up/down is terrible and doesn't work. I hate always having to switch to Rotten Tomatoes or IMDB to get the star ratings for movies.

The are you watching feature does not work on this version on a Note 8. I usually fall asleep watching the office but instead of kicking off after a couple episodes after I fall asleep I wake up the next morning and Jim and Pam are getting married

Updated the app and facing a problem with the google cast icon. The cast icon doesn't seems to be working, * i tried to select my tv--> i clicked on its name/tv model or something like that in the cast icon and nothing happened. Tried multiple times and still nothing. FIX IT PLEASE

The star rating needs to come back, I don't watch Netflix nearly as much as I once did because of the fact I cant see if the content on the app is worth watching. Ive tried to watch a couple of the movies with a "98% match" and they absolutely suck. Also all the good movies are being removed fro...Full Review

Why keep changing the layout? I like the forward and backward button. If it wasnt for the easy accessible layout.. i wld prob give 4 stars.

Seriously fix this issue... i love Netflix but you have to stop messing with it! If it's not broke don't fix it.... well now it's broke can't fast forward or review anything in the episode I am on just says loading very frustrating...

The application crashes and logs me out of the account randomly. I have had to log in 5 times within a 30 minute span.

It crashes frequently, everytime I skip the intro to a show or pause or crashes and signs me out of the app. Really thinking about canceling my membership if this keeps up. (Galaxy S8 Plus)

The you choose adventure, puss in boots is not a you choose adventure like it used to be. FIX IT NOW!!!!!!!!!! This used to be something fun to do but now you have renewed it. This is not cool. Now it's just a useless extra. Try to make it the way it used to be.

As of this last update, no problems, thanks. I enjoy much of Netflix originals, as well as being able to watch other things like some of the newer Disney movies. I do sometimes wish there was a bigger selection of older movies, otherwise great.

Latest updates have turned this app into utter trash. Constant video distortion, frequent errors, and constantly being logged out in the middle of a show. One star until these issues are fixed.

After doing the latest 2 updates. It logs me out after every single episode and if it's paused for too long! Please correct asap.

The new update doesn't work on my Samsung galaxy s9. I'm logged out every time I try to do anything. The video starts out garbled if I ever get to the video. Someone screwed up.

Depois de uma nova atualização, simplesmente, sumiu todas as categorias de gêneros de títulos que eu poderia assistir. Só aparece Filmes, Séries e Tudo, nada mais. O design para o LG G6 está incrível, mas falta todos os recursos!

Since last update, every few days it asks me to sign in, nd then it says unable to reach netflix service. So every few days I have to uninstall and install the app again.

This app is amazing and has gotten me through many long and difficult days, however lately ever single time I try to watch any episode or movie of any program, it always ends with the same result. It restarts my phone, any explanations on this would be greatly appreciated.

The app needs FastForward, Rewind buttons. It is frustrating that there is only a 30 second skip back option but no 30 second skip forward button. Over all, the app developer did not think it through well about users expectations from the app. It sucks.

The new rating system is useless. Having to resort to alternative rating sites. 99% match is total bull****.

I am unable to sign in suddenly. I keep getting a message saying 'Netflix Site Error'. Please assist.

Hey! I can't load any of the movies/series. My internet connection is okay, I updated the app and everything. Help! It keeps saying that there is a problem with the video?

Ever since the latest update I have to re-sign in literally after every episode. If I want to fast forward in an episode it loads and loads then makes me sign in again and I still can't fast forward! This is the second review I've left about this now and I have had netflix for six years if yall ...Full Review

This app is annoying in terms of constantly signing me out. I think it got to do with Android devices because my brothers (apple users) never complained so fix this glitch!

I like the content. My only gripe are the button placements. I liked the previous one where the pause/play button was at the middle and the presence of a +10 / - 10 second buttons

Problem with the cast function. Cant cast to my sony bravia smart tv. When you press the cast button and choose where to cast the app does in fact turn on the netflix app on the tv. But it doesnt play the movie.

The app. Keeps booting me off mid show / movie and when you play anything the screen is all different colors and freezes then makes you sign back in NETFLIX WHAT IS GOING ON ????????

Netflix is lacking..... i'm looking for a replacement. To much non english subtitle movies. If i wanted to read id go to the library. Im getting bored with the service

When are they going to put shadow hunters on this. And put more shows on the US one like Teen wolf and others plz if not I will tell people to stop useing this app

I wrote a detailed paragraph but it got deleted and I'm too lazy to rewrite it. Summary: I would have given it five stars, but the new update sucks--too much lag. Fix it or change it back to the previous version.

Figured i would switch back to Netflix with Hulu refusing to fix their horrible new UI. Netflix skip intro is a dream come true (I don't understand why others don't offer this). When you're casting, it puts a skip episode icon on the lockscreen. The skip episode doesn't work when i want it to, b...Full Review

Lots of old movies still not in net flix. Was planning to watch MCU movies but it was incomplete here. Probably this will be my last months subscription.

Netflix is cool. But recently the took a lot of stuff that I liked off. Also it updated pretty slowly. Other than that everything is cool. I'm also glad that there ore no ads and it is categorized nicely.

I'm having massive trouble with my subscription since the android app is forcing me to pay through Google play, while I added my debit card to Google play now it refuses to renew my subscription. Also the app to Chrome to Google play redirects are quite annoying - I can't even see my subscriptio...Full Review

It keeps on throwing me out and making me log in every time I mess with the time trying to either get ahead in a movie or go back.

You can add more movies from the past because people may want to look back at the things that they watched long ago and Netflix if your reading this your awesome please add blackpanther and avangers infinity war and all of the upcoming movies because when you add the movies that where released on...Full Review

Too often I need to login again, then the app log-me out, then I have to login again ... This happens lot of times, I live abroad and I think there's a country checking logic somewhere that's mess up everything ...

It's a great app. if only it would work. I can hardly play anything without getting an error saying Netflix unavailable. I love using it but I need it to work

Good app but not happy that one of my devices (the one I primarily use to watch it) is all of a sudden "unsupported". Very annoyed and I hope it is fixed soon.

I reactivated my Netflix My videos are taking a really long time to buffer and has a weird blurry screen. And for some reason everytime a fast forward or rewind the video loads for 5 seconds then completely logs me out EVERY TIME. It's getting really annoying. Also why isn't there a fast forward ...Full Review

I love Netflix! It has a bunch of shows and movies and changes every month. I'm watching Pretty Little Liars on Netflix right now.

The user experience should be improved... Navigation is very poor and many logical areas are missing like reviews as an example, proper categories charts and so on... Funny that pirated content apps are doing better like popcorn and stremio

This is the best I can watch what I want when I want. And with now there is so much new content I have a hard time committing to just one show. Love it.

It's a pretty good. I mainnly use it to watch the US version of The Office (UK version is good, too). John Krasinski and BJ Novak are my main men, dude.

Netflix is a battery hogger. With Android Oreo the problem gets worse. Will need to think about other apps if this continues :-(

Been using Netflix for years. All of a sudden it logged me out and I cannot use it. Price went up. Service went down. 🙁🙁

Having a lot of problems lately keep getting kicked out I've uninstalled and reinstalled twice and still messing up

The app seems to crash my razer phone infrequently, when it does this my phone hard crashes and ends up resetting itself after about 2 mins.

Why does Netflix have to take off the good shows. Like I was in the middle of a show and they just take it off. Netflix needs to bring back the good stuff and take off the bad.

As promised upgraded my review to 5 stars thanks to the return of the 10 seconds fast forward and rewind. Please keep them as its a mission without these buttons.

the app won't work. I've tried everything and all that comes up is the black screen that says NETFLIX in red.

You have a dedicated "Kids Section". Please put all children's TV in there, not being a Child I have no wish to view any of it or have it cluttering up the adult section. The newest update does not always save the last viewed part of the film or episode, ie some times the episode or film will sta...Full Review

I just use this to watch Stranger Things, Supernatural, and iZombie. It's really good ssssooo 👍👍

Really like it, but sometimes the movie or show can lag. But overall I really like and enjoy this app!

I love netflix it does have great netflix movies and great netflix shows BUT can u upload movies other than netflix made tooo?? Lately i haven't seen alot of movies that come from out on theaters

The app is great overall however i do not like the fact that you remove shows that are being watched ,for example the show "lost" i was only up to season 4 ep 1

Great service, AWFUL app! Love Netflix, I actually just changed my 5 star rating to a 1, because it simply will not connect if it doesn't feel like it. It randomly logs me out and won't take my password. I use a different device and it won't load my account. Doesn't matter if it is on wifi or on ...Full Review

Makes me sign in everytime a show ends. Brutal. Or says my password is wrong when I just used it 30 minutes before to watch a TV show. And sometimes it just kicks me out then asks me to log in again. Never use to be like this... Brutal

Oh man I'm so happy...best customer response, wanted a forwards button so badly and you guys have done it! Love Netflix, thankyou

Don't you dare changing this layout. Big buttons in the middle of the screen, 10 sec back and forth, nice to have it back.

wors movie app. It has only like. 200 old. movies. Horrible. Red box. Is. Better. Netflix. Sucks. 👎👎👎👎

its because you dont have that much anime shows and you dont update your seasons on your app also you dont have a lot of good movies and shows

There's direct access to your account if there's an issue to report with shows or movies. It would be great if there were the option to skip intros to shows on the TV like there are with this app.

Its very nice and I love the app ever since the first time I tried it. Its quite addictive but great!

I can only see the forward or rewind 10 secs option sometimes. Can you advise what the issue is?

Everything is perfect but the app keeps on logging me out! I can't watch a full episode without getting kicked out!

I love Netflix, but it just freezes and crashes when I try and watch it (Razer Phone) and forces my phone to restart..

I get signed out after every video/episode I watch... C'mon netflix

App & content is great, but not so much as to ditch/switch from all others. THAT SAID, depending on May schedule - if Michelle Wolf actually gets her show - I might be canceling my Netflix subscription anyway. HELLO HULU, AMAZON PRIME VIDEO & MANY OTHERS!

Keeps signing out as I watch anything. Using S8+. Don't have this issue on any other device.

Would gave 5 stars but alot of movies I search for I can't get. I know they have because there older movies.

Please fix the app. Ever since the update, nothing loads properly

Its a nice app we can watch tv shows, movies kids cartoon shows here.

Dissapoinmented that their isn't any older movies like: Dirty Dancing, The Mutan Ninja Turtles Movie, Wild America, etc.... I just wish that you had more movies available like when you search for a movie you absoueltly have it like going to a Blockbuster which had everything or a Hastings; Which ...Full Review

Netflix is so awesome bc I get to watch any of my favorite shows plus new shows and Netflix Original!

In the latest update the video keeps on playing when the screen is turned off instead of it being automatically paused. The arrow/cursor keys on my bluetooth keyboard also won't let me fast forward or rewind anymore (which was a very useful feature). Also in the search text box there is no cursor...Full Review

Nonlonger finds my chromecast on my lg v30 making this app mostly useless

The movies and shows wouldn't load. They finally DO load, I accidentally pressed the back button and it won't save my spot

The Netflix originals are on point, when you want to binge watch!

I look for scify,documentaries and comedy Ser ing es or movies you have a fair variety

Garbage app, translation keeps switching as soon as you stop watching and the downloads gets erased if you don't re download it for a while but you cant just redownload it from the downloaded page so you have to redownload all individually.

Ever since I updated the app, it freezes every few minutes and forces me to sign in again. This becomes increasingly annoying when you're really trying to get into a show or movie. Very frustrating

Y'all took off goodfellas, smh, please bring it back<3

This app is very nice for when you have nothing to do with your life and just binge watching everything

Greatest and very easiest app I ever experienced. Thank you 🤗🤗Netflix and play store

I am new to it. However, would like a more descriptive sections such as fiction, horror, mythology fiction etc..

Netflixs has come a long way from having no movie titles at all to have the most.. I would say if they can do live TV then I could have everything I need in one app. Maybe that's something they will bring in the future ***Up date****2018****/ If you not used Netflixs in a while I suggest that you...Full Review

I tire of the selection but I have only myself to blame.

Why are there now red borders when watching shows ore movies? It is very distracting! Please change it back to black. If this continues I cancel my subscription.

Its great! They get a lot of new movies but I do with they would get older series

I have been a long time customer but the update broke the app have to sign in all the time and get Netflix can't be reached this needs attention are I will cancel

Latest update allows Netflix to override Blue Light Filter on my Galaxy S9+. Before the update I could watch movies with the Blue Light Filter on, this latest update turns the Blue Light Filter off. Please look in to this.

I think you need to update Netflix, because there's a lot of TV shows and movies that you think would be on Netflix, but aren't on it... You need to update Netflix

Don't like the update, each to their own.Just waiting for something better.

I would like it more if you leave the option where you can skip 10 seconds

I hate the new stupid UK/USA bull, I want to watch all my favourite movies but I can't because they "aren't available in my reigon" like I know the whole twighlight saga is on there but it won't come up at all for me, son of a peice of toast

I will up the review once the app actually starts working good again and stops signing me out every 2 minutes!

I'm using android phn after an update in the search option i am not able see the categories of movie like action ,horror , thriller .

I have installed it numerous times & also uninstalled due to it saying error every time l clicked on movie it's a real pain in the ass

This app is awesome! I have used it for 5 yrs, and I have never encountered any bugs!

The app keeps kicking me out after each episode. I have to log back in every time. The has been happening for about a week.

There's some movies and animes not in there.. I was hoping that you could add them in netflix. So i can watch But , it it good so far , it does not lag Keep up the good work

I like Netflix but when a new season on a show comes out I takes then forever to pit on netflix such as Riverdale

Ever since the last update, whenever I click next episode, or skip intro, it logs me out. Is really freaking annoying.

I like Netflix more than Hulu bc there is no commercials and I dont have to pay more to get rid of them.

The app won't stream above standard definition on any of my devices, regardless of how fast my internet is. Very annoying.

The app constantly pixelates the screen and will only play the sound. It will then log me out and ask me to log in again.

It's amazing and addictive can watch all my favourite shows if I could I would give it 💯 stars thank you

It keeps on saying ""Can't connect to Netflix"" my wifi is good i have the new update WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS.

I have been trying to cast from my galaxy s7 to my smart tv and roku box and getting the same 16001 timed out message!

Not fair how Netflix in Canada has much less content than that of Netflix in the U.S. Nice app, biased service.

HELP! I use to be able to easily double tap the edge of the screen to fast forward by 10 seconds. This has since been removed. I loved this feature! What's happening with it? I'm not alone!

Its awesome u get to watch movies before they come out.

The app freezes on the opening netflix screen since the update

It is a great app, however after the last update I lost the option to forward 10 seconds. It would be nice to add it back as sometimes there is a need to forward the scene and not just rewind.

It doesn't work i try everything but not helpful at all

It's good contains and nice programmes but not working on my mobile for few days, I tried to reinstall it but still not working. Need some solution or I will have to remove my subscription

Netflix just really got on my nerves I was in the middle of watching a series and now it's not on Netflix anymore

Since new update it auto plays downloaded next épisodes, but it shouldn't from settings.

App won't properly connect to the PlayStation 3, please fix. NOW. It's annoying has hell.

What the hell happen? I even can't sign up on my phone. It doesn't work

This app keeps on getting disconnected from chromecast

So da problema, como agora que nem uma série ou filme começa

I dont like the fact that when youve watched a movie so many times it gets rid of it

I can't log in from my account it says 'we can't find an email account with this email address ' please fix it i really want to watch. I'll rate it five star if u fix it. Thank you

Please please add forward button in interface like, 5 second forward with on touch or multiple 5 sec with multiple touch....

No new movies worth my time. Selection has been horrible lately

Netflix does not have latest TV shows episodes and Movies, second thing create a password for every screen in Netflix it would not allow other profile members to see the activity of others........

The subtitles are appearing with a delay after the update. Can you please fix that

The playback controlled are sometimes in the bottom left With only a 30s rewind (which is bad) and sometimes in the center with a 10s rewind and skip (which is much better). I'd like to see that fixed.

I'm unable to sign in totally hate it😠😠

I Don't Get Passed The Netflix Title Screen, Please Fix This!!!

Starting to suck, shutting down and logging out several times a day.

I like the app but u recently logout and it keeps saying I'm putting and incorrect password or email and I'm not and it's frustrating I don't know how to get back in

Tired of having less titles than other countries. It's boring

I really like the improvements i can now watch without buffering that use to be a problem not anymore thanks you guys im very happy

I like it, but sometimes it randomly shuts down my phone

It has very good and amazing movies and series. But sometimes, the suggestion doesn't match the genre I'm searching. But all in all, it's a great app!

Well I wanted to watch pokemon idk why they removed... I request to add them back...

The is broken now when I load it up it flicker all the time

Watch z nation or you are a lame

You remove movies and shows that I like watching. How could you expect people to stick with your service when you want us to pay more and shows keep getting removed?

Thanks for updating the network issue.

Honestly can't fault it right now, the app is great, very responsive, casting works perfectly, worth every penny

I'm really upset that the latest update broke screen mirroring

It cannot connect to my TCL smart Tv

All i can say is I Hate you I Love you I Hate that you deleted. Movies that I loooooooove.

Stopped working. Stuck at load screen. Tried uninstalling. Galaxy S7

Constantly changing password and it STILL won't let me log in! I am using the right information and everything!!

I wish Netflix has Disney and Nickelodeon shows on it like iCarly

Last update removed Bluetooth control support... Big loss

It's movie Worthy and everything is awesome,but I think an Update showing movie/Show recap plus a forwarding button would do

WHY I MUST PAY. IM A STUDENT AND I DONT HAVE A LOT MONEY FOR PAY😣😣😣

This has all your favorite movies an shows

I don't like the sign in

It's really good I'm glad they have it , it might not have all my favorite shows but what evs

Worst/rudest customer service of all time.

It's a nonsense app. While signing in it's saying my email id is not valid. I'm using the same id for so long. Ridiculous app

Irritating that most new releases are in foriegn language.

Keep crashing and logging me out of account.
