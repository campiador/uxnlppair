# uxnlppair

This project was designed and implemented by Behnam Heydarshahi and Ge Gao in 2018 as our final project for the course Natural Language Processing at Tufts University.

We use Scala and Breeze to read user reviews of an app on Google Play store.
We break down the comments into k different topics, using a number of NLP techniques such as SVD decomposition, tfidf, and topic modeling.
