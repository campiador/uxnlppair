More and more of the shows i watch are being removed yet my cost is going up. Got a new update today and now the shows that i still watch aren't playing. It keeps freezing up and is picking and choosing what it will play and what it won't. I'm getting closer and closer to dropping netflix by the day. Not a happy customer right now! ðŸ˜’

I used to love watching Netflix on my phone, but since the last update over a month ago, it is using up my battery at an alarming rate. Even when it is force stopped, my phone feels hot and the battery won't last a day. Considering I can watch YouTube all day and barely lose half the battery, this is atrocious.

The app keeps draining my battery when I am not even using the app.  This has happed a couple of times.  I never had the app running but it showed up under battery usage as the highest consumer.\

Drains battery like crazy since a recent update, whether I'm using the app or not. Have to force kill it whenever I'm not using it to avoid battery getting drained.

The latest update has an issue where often the video hangs and freezes a while the audio continues. Internet speeds are between 10-20mbs vdsl which is more than adequate to run Netflix. Please fix this to get a 5 star review.

Was working perfectly, but after upgrade the app freezes, reboots, the picture gets pixelated, and gives the 5.2 error code quite often. I either have to reboot my phone or reinstall the app all together. Not acceptable service to pay for.

Recently, I cant even open it or switch profiles without a message appearing saying "Can't Connect to Netflix", even though my internet and my other apps work smoothly. What's going on?? Its been a huge inconvenience. I'm considering uninstalling.

This app is constantly crashing. I'm always having to restart, not just the app but my phone because I'll get a message saying my device needs to be restarted.

Not working on all my devices. Fix problem asap! I am not paying monthly to get "Can't Connect to Netflix" RETRY every time I open the app on my phone. Problem has been happening over the past few days, have updated app & still the same issue.

New updates have been hard to work with and use. Mostly great. Does turn off once every few days randomly. Also some movies have been removed and I'm slightly upset because I love Princess Bride and it's gone now. New movies are great to watch but wish they were added faster. Also I don't like that ...
